## Work Envelope
OpenBuilds’ open-source linear rails were used as both the linear motion rails and the frame for the system. Specifically, V-rails were chosen because of their ability to easily connect to form the work envelope. The work envelope contains all of the accessories required for an experiment (e.g., tip boxes, well plates, etc.), as well as the pipette tip sensors, attached to the bottom with 3D-printed holders and fasteners.

## Axes
The linear actuator of the X-axis is a timing belt/pulley configuration to maximize speed. 8-mm lead screws were used for the Y- and Z-axes for increased stability and accuracy.

## Gantry
Our design utilizes a gantry system to take advantage of higher accuracy and more work space if needed. The Z- and X- axes form the gantry assembly, which rides on a pair of linear rails and lead screws that comprise the Y-axis.

## Pipetting Assembly
A Haydon Kerk® captive linear stepper motor comprises the pipetting linear actuator. It sits above the micropipette and automates the pressing of the plunger on the micropipette.

## Floating Head Assembly
The pipetting assembly rides on a pair of vertical, spring-loaded linear rods to create the floating head assembly. The spring constants of the springs used determine the micropipette’s tip loading pressure. The entire assembly includes a plate attached to V-wheels, which ride on the linear rails of the gantry.
