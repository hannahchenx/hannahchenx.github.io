<h1>OTTO</h1>
<p>The automated micropipette</p>

OTTO is an open-source liquid handler that can automatically prepare samples for qPCR, flow cytometry, and other biological assays that rely on accurate liquid dispensing. It features designs that optimize speed and accuracy, unattended automation, and modular components, all with easily sourceable or 3D-printed parts. In total, OTTO only costs approximately $1000 and works with most commercially available micropipettes and plastic labware, so you can use materials you already own.
